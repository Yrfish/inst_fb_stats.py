Scrapper to get the stats from FB and IG


Big wrangler for my own using. That based on Selenium
Developed for crawl throught the instagram and FB to get data like: comments, reaching, likes, reposts. And store followed data to xlsx sheet.

Wtite data to xlsx using openpyxl and add to file name current month with datetime lib

Want to deelop new tool for that becose existing scrapper depends on xpath. As we know Meta very often change markup, so it dematd to change code as soon as meta did it
